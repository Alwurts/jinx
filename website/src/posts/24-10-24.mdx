# Welcome to the jinx Blog Portal!

This is one of the many places where we will announce updates and share results, reports, and insights into the behind-the-scenes of our projects and operations.

We are a group of five Master's students in the field of web engineering, and this blog represents a significant milestone project we need to complete during our studies.

## Week One Update

As of week one, we have been busy with preparation and planning for building an initial setup. Here are the steps we have taken so far:

### 1. Finding a Proper Name for the Company

Initially, we considered using the first initials of each team member to create a name, which resulted in "AKAXI." However, after discussions and brainstorming, we realized this name didn't effectively convey the purpose or spirit of our startup. During one of our brainstorming sessions, we stumbled upon the name "jinx," and it resonated with all of us. We believe this name captures our vision perfectly, and we look forward to sharing more about it in the upcoming weeks.

### 2. Logo Design

We had numerous ideas about how to represent ourselves visually, but ultimately, we decided on a design that symbolizes our unity as five team members. The logo represents a hand made up of all of us standing together and working as one cohesive unit toward a common goal. This visual effectively captures our ambition and story. We also chose a unified color palette based on color psychology and its impact on trust and branding.

### 3. Choosing the Tech Stack for Our Initial Website

Since most startups and SaaS companies are built using JavaScript, and we are all familiar with this programming language, we decided to use a tech stack in this realm. Our project will utilize **Next.js** for both front-end and back-end development. Additionally, we will use **PostgreSQL** and **Prisma** as our ORM. The project will be hosted on GitHub for version control, while Vercel will serve as our main deployment platform. So far, we have created our repository, developed the landing page for the company, and applied all the logic and design we envisioned in one place.

### 4. Project Management Tools and Meeting Schedule

For project management, we will implement a Kanban approach, utilizing the steps: To-Do, In Progress, QA, and Done. This process will be collaboratively managed by all of us, and we will participate in reviewing each other's code. Each team member will have designated internal roles, but we will also support each other in every way possible.

Stay tuned for next weekâ€™s update and progress report. Once again, weâ€™re excited to jinx it! ðŸš€
