# jinxify's Refined Focus on AI-Driven HR Recruitment

We're excited to share our latest developments and strategic shift towards AI-driven HR recruitment processes for SMEs. Our team has been hard at work refining jinxify to meet the specific needs of HR managers in smaller companies.

## Key Developments
Over the holiday period, we completed several crucial tasks:

**Finalized dashboard layout**

**Developed user preference management**

**Implemented light and dark mode**

**Added search functionality**

**Introduced favorites feature**

## Strategic Pivot

After careful market analysis, we've identified HR managers in SMEs as our primary target group. 

This decision was driven by:

- Challenges of manual, time-consuming recruitment processes.

- Resource constraints in smaller companies.

- Urgent need for efficient recruitment tools.

- Significant potential of AI to transform SME recruitment.

- AI-Powered Recruitment Tools.

We've developed three key AI-driven editors to address critical HR tasks:

**Job Offer Creation**: Generate professional, role-specific job offers using our Markdown Editor

**Interview Preparation**: Create tailored questionnaires with our AI-assisted Form Editor

**Onboarding Processes**: Design and automate workflows with our BPMN Editor

## Meet Jane: Our New User Persona

 To embody our target audience, we've created Jane, an HR professional in an SME:
- Based in Manchester, UK
- Goal-oriented and empathetic
- Passionate about fostering strong company culture
- Motivated by improving recruitment processes and employee experience

Jane's motto: "Finding the right people is the foundation for success - tools should make it easier, not harder"
